# README_generator

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a quick readme generator that can be used for future projects. I learned how to use node.js and how to run the program. 

## Installation

To use this README.md generator you'll need to navigate to your project directory using your terminal. Run the command and answer the prompted questions. Once the questions are answered, then a README.md will be generatored. Watch this video for directions.
